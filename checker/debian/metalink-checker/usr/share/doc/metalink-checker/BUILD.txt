How to build Metalink Checker

You will need the following:

Python 2.5.2 - http://www.python.org

py2exe 0.6.6 - http://www.py2exe.org
 -OR-
pyinstaller 1.3 - http://pyinstaller.python-hosting.com/

The program can be run as a normal Python script if Python is present.  
Pyinstaller and py2exe are not required, these are included only for 
supporting distribution to the masses without Python.

Building on Windows
-------------------
pyinstexe.bat - calls pyinstaller to make executable files for windows and .zip package
setup.py merge - generates a single metalink.py script from the library
